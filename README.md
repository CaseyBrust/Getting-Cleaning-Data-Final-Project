##Repository Contents
1. README.md: contains information as to all files in repo and the goal of the assignment
2. CodeBook.md: code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R: script that does the following:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
